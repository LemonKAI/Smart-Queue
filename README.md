## Description of the Project (300 words)
Due to its small area of land and high population, Hong Kong ranks 4th in population density in the world. As there is a saying that “Hong Kong restaurants sell food to pay the rent”, such situation naturally leads to a high housing price and rental price for businesses. 

This indicates that turnover rate for restaurants in Hong Kong is crucial for sustainable business operation. Thus, most of the restaurants, especially the ones run by corporates, adapt queuing system to maximize the turnover rate. 

However, it often leads to unsatisfying customer experience and our project is to tackle this issue with our new system.
